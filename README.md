# üå¶Ô∏è Climate Risk Index (CRI)

This folder contains the preprocessing of the **Climate Risk Index** for the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines, using historical weather and air quality data obtained from **OpenWeatherMap (OWM)** APIs.  
The CRI will serve as a regional indicator for climate-related stressors affecting last-mile delivery riders across Metro Manila.

## üóÇÔ∏è I. Datasets

### a. OpenWeatherMap Historical Records  
Climate metrics sampled from **July 2024 to June 2025**, divided into two data sets:

- **Set A:** Temperature (¬∞C), Humidity (%), Precipitation (mm), and Wind Speed (m/s)  
- **Set B:** Air Quality Index (AQI)

### b. NCR Land Administration Border  
- Polygon boundary of **Metro Manila** generated using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io).

## ‚öôÔ∏è II. Processes

### a. Coordinate Sampling ‚Äî `ncr_coor_sampling.py`
Generates **30 spatially distributed points** across Metro Manila.  
These coordinates serve as sampling sites for weather and AQI data collection.

### b. OpenWeatherMap API Calls
- **`climate_API_call.py`** ‚Äî Fetches data for Set A metrics (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed).  
- **`aqi_API_call.py`** ‚Äî Fetches data for Set B (Air Quality Index).

### c. Data Cleaning and Weight Calculation ‚Äî `shannon_weight.py`
Performs the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing or inconsistent entries.  
2. **Outlier Treatment:** Uses *Winsorization* to cap extreme values.  
3. **Normalization:** Each metric is scaled to its regional **min‚Äìmax range**.  
4. **Entropy Weight Computation:** Uses the Shannon entropy method to determine metric weights.

The Shannon Entropy weight is calculated as:

where:  
- \( n \) = number of indicators  
- \( m \) = number of samples  
- \( x<sub>ij</sub> \) = normalized value of the \( j<sup>th</sup>} \) metric at point \( i \)  
- \( e<sub>j</sub> \) = entropy value of the \( j<sup>th</sup> \) metric  

The **weight** of each metric is then computed as:

## üìà III. Key Outputs

- ‚úÖ **Shannon Entropy Weights** for each climate metric  
- ‚úÖ **Regional Minimum and Maximum** for each metric (used in normalization)

These outputs are stored as CSV or JSON files for downstream analysis.

## üì± IV. Climate Risk Index Computation (in Flutter)

The final **Climate Risk Index (CRI)** is computed within the **Flutter application** using the **Weighted Arithmetic Mean Index** formula:

where:  
- \( CRI<sub>i</sub> \) = Climate Risk Index of sample point \( i \)  
- \( w<sub>j</sub> \) = Shannon entropy weight of metric \( j \)  
- \( x<sub>ij</sub> \) = normalized value of metric \( j \) at point \( i \)

Higher **CRI** values indicate greater climate-related risk intensity at that location.
